Pokemon Battle Arena (Canvas game)

[Link to game](https://dinaco.github.io/ironhack-project-1/)

This project was developed during my time at Ironhack's Bootcamp. It's a canvas game based on Pokemon battle arena style. You can choose from 4 different pokemons to start the game and as you keep defeating your opponents, your pokemon evolves improving its attack and defense levels. Be careful to not be defeated by the other pokemons, because they do strike back.
